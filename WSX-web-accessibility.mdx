# Module 1: What is Web Accessibility

## 1.2 Technology enabling people with disabilities

### 1.2.1 Accessibility is about people

- Accessibility is not about a checklist it’s about people

### 1.2.2 Knowledge check

- The most important thing is making technology work well for people with disabilities. (Standards are just one way to help with that.)

### 1.2.3 Introduction to screen readers

- Page title
- Headings H1, H2 ...
- Links with meaningful text
- Alt for images, short and simple
- Bullet points

### 1.2.4 Accessibility of life and death information

### 1.2.5 Some other people who use screen readers

- Screen readers are used by:
  ** people who are totally blind and listen to the screen reader
  ** people who are blind and deaf and use a dynamic braille display
  ** people who are blind and can hear the screen reader, and also use a dynamic braille display
  ** some people with low vision who can see some of the text
  ** some people with cognitive disabilities who can see just fine, yet have difficulty processing written ** text and can process spoken language better
  \*\* and others

- Digital braille display

### 1.2.6 More people (who don't use screen readers)

- People will use multiple ways of receiving information, especially when degenerating, still try to read but bigger text, still try to listen but with subtitles on...

### 1.2.7 Knowledge check

- When watching videos online, some people who are hard-of-hearing will listen to the audio and also read captions.
- Some people use multiple assistive technologies or adaptive strategies.

### 1.2.8 Activity - Use the web without a mouse

### 1.2.9 Demo: Reading with and without wrapping

- This next activity illustrates the importance of text wrapping that is making sure that you don't have to scroll both horizontally and vertically to read a block of text.

### 1.2.10 Activity: Browsing with increased spacing

### 1.2.11 Web accessibility importance, right

### 1.2.12 Optional Activity: Videos of assistive technology or adaptive strategies

## 1.3 Accessibility is for everyone

### 1.3.1 Scope of Accessibility

### 1.3.2 Web Accessibility is…

- Accessibility is:
- Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

  - perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
  - contribute to the Web

- Range of abilities
- Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:

  - auditory
  - cognitive
  - neurological
  - physical
  - speech
  - visual

- Related areas
- Accessibility overlaps with several areas, including inclusion, design for all, universal design, and addressing the digital divide. These other areas address broad issues of geographic location, economic situation, education, language, age, gender, and more — including disability.

- Accessibility has a more limited focus on people with disabilities. As you’re learning throughout this course, most of the things we do to support accessibility, also benefit people without disabilities, especially people in the situations addressed by these other areas. It’s is beneficial to promote the overlap, while maintaining the focus of accessibility on people with disabilities.

- Similarly, accessibility is related to user experience, usability, and user-centered design. One of the reasons to understand this is that the methodologies and techniques in user-centered design work well for addressing the needs of people with disabilities, and including them, in creating accessible websites and apps.

### 1.3.3 Knowledge check

- Accessibility focuses on people with disabilities. The others usually cover many more areas.

- It is benefitial to keep accessibility focused on people with disabilities, and consider the broader benefits in other areas such as inclusion and design for all.
- The methodologies and techniques in user-centered design work well for addressing the needs of people with disabilities, and including people with disabilities, in creating accessible websites and apps.

### 1.3.4 Activity: Challenging assumptions and understanding differences

### 1.3.5 Benefits to others

Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:

people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
older people with changing abilities due to ageing
person typing with one hand, other arm is in a sling
people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm
people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight
people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth

### 1.3.6 WAI Perspectives Video

- Video Captions
- Colours with Good Contrast
- Voice recognition
- Text to speech
- Clear layout and design
- Notifications and feedback
- Large links, buttons and controls
- Customisable text
- Understandable content
- Keyboard compatibility

### 1.3.7 Demo: Benefits to all users and website owners

### 1.3.8 Disability is mismatched design

### 1.3.9 Knowledge check

- Which of the following statements are correct?
  - The "social model" is that disability is caused by a mismatch between the design and the person.
  - Bad design and bad code is disabling.
  - When designs and code provide the flexibility to meet users' needs, then they are enabling.

###

### 1.3.11 Accessibility is built in fundamentally

## 1.4 Conclusion

- At the beginning of this module, Shawn emphasized that the purpose of accessibility for websites, apps, and other digital technology is:
  - to make them work well for people with disabilities
- The first thing to do to learn about making the web accessible to people with disabilities is to read all of the W3C accessibility guidelines.
  - First, it's best to understand the basics of how people with disabilities use the web. Standards are important, yet not the first step.
- Accessible website, apps, and other digital technology can benefit which of the following?
  - people with disabilities
  - people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
  - older people with changing abilities due to ageing
  - people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm
  - people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight
  - people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth.
- Most people with a "visual disability" rely on a screen reader that reads aloud the text that is displayed on the monitor.
  - Many people with low vision do not use a screen reader -- including people who are losing their vision from progressive eye conditions later life. There are many more people with low vision than there are people who are blind.
- Only people who are blind or have significant low vision use screen readers. People who can see well do not use screen readers.
  - Other people use screen readers, too; for example, Sarah and others with cognitive disabilities who have trouble processing text that they read and who can process text that the hear better.
- Everyone with "low vision" needs large text with lots of space between lines.
  - Some people with "tunnel vision" and good visual acuity need small text with little space between lines.
- The main point of the Web Accessibility Perspectives video (that showed people using accessibility features in many situations) is:
  - Web accessibility is essential for some, and useful for all. (While we talked about not being able to use the mouse at the beginning of the module, the rest of the module -- and the Web Accessibility Perspectives video -- addressed many more issues.)
- Digital accessibility addresses the user needs of people with which of the following disabilities?
  - auditory
  - cognitive
  - neurological
  - physical
  - speech
  - visual
- Making websites, apps, and other digital technologies accessible can help who:
  - organizations
  - society
  - individuals who want create high-quality websites, apps, etc.
  - individuals who may become disabled from accident, illness, ageing, or other

# Module 2: People and Digital Technology

## 2.1 Introduction

## 2.2 Assistive technologies and adaptive strategies

- Assistive Technologies refer to hardware or software that enable people with disabilities to interact and engage with the digital environment e.g. using a screen reader or a switch control.
- Adaptive Strategies are techniques that people with disabilities use to interact with the digital environment such as adjusting platform and browser settings or resizing browser windows.

- What is the definition of assistive technology?
  - A hardware and/or software that people with disabilities use to adapt and access content
- Which adaptive strategies make audiovisual presentations more accessible?
  - Using closed captions
  - Using audio description

## 2.3 Physical and visual

### 2.3.1 Physical disabilities

- Keyboard accessibility
- Lack of visible focus
- Focus order
- Skip links
- Target size and movement

### 2.3.2 Switch controls

- Sip-and-puff switches which are triggered by sipping and puffing into a straw which then mimics tabbing and clicking.
- Button switches which can be activated using the hand, foot or head. These can be single switches or multiple switches.
- Camera switches which can be activated when tilting the head into a camera. Some mobile phones have this built into the accessibility settings.
- Eye tracking, the process of measuring either the point of gaze (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head.

### 2.3.3 Speech input

Common issues are:

- Unclear links and buttons - if a button lacks visible text, a user will not know its name and how to activate it. Instead, they will have to number links on a page and select the link by its number.
- Lack of keyboard access - if a user can not set focus on a button, it can not be activated.
- Illogical focus order - if the focus order is different from the visual order of a page, it can confuse users and they can loose track of where focus is.
- Missing or poor visible focus - when focus states are not clear it might not be possible to know where the current focus is.

### 2.3.4 Demo: Kim and speech input

- Make space for scrolling dialog boxes as large as possible.
- Make sure the system focus is clearly visible.
- And if you use custom keyboard shortcuts, allow users to customize, save, and share those shortcuts.

### 2.3.5 Knowledge check

- What are essential design features for speech input?
  - Visible focus
  - Visible labels on buttons
- What type of assistive technology could help a user with limited upper body movement?

### 2.3.7 Blindness

- Alternatives
- Keyboard accessibility
- Structure

### 2.3.8 Screen readers

### 2.3.9 Demo: Anthony and his desktop screen reader

### 2.3.10 Demo: Anthony and his mobile screen reader

### 2.3.11 Activity - Using iOS VoiceOver and Android TalkBack

### 2.3.12 Knowledge check

- What challenges do braille display users and users with physical impairments have in common?
  - Lack of keyboard accessibility and missing labels on buttons
  - Lack of keyboard accessibility and illogical focus order
- What does Screen Curtain do on iOS?
  - Screen curtain switches the screen off so you can test content without seeing it.

### 2.3.13 Low vision

- Font size
- Poor contrast
- Relying on color
- Animations and moving content
- Point of regard

### 2.3.14 Screen magnification

- Smoothing to make text less blocky and smooth when enlarged and therefore easier to read
- Crosshairs as an alternative to the pointer as some find these easier to follow visually, especially when the size and color can be customized
- Color inversion e.g. turning text from black-on-white to white-on-black. This can reduce screen glare and is useful for elderly people suffering from age-related macular degeneration

### 2.3.15 Demo: Juan and screen magnification

- Number one:
  - Ensure on screen changes are obvious to screen magnification users.
- Number two:
  - Ensure key content is not contained within hover states or tooltips.
- Number three:
  - Ensure priority content is positioned consistently and where people expect to find it.

### 2.3.16 Knowledge check

- Why are tooltips problematic for screen magnification users?
  - Content in tooltips sometimes opens off screen and is lost
- Are responsive websites beneficial to screen magnification users?
  - Yes, because content resizing to a single column reduces scrolling which is tiring

## 2.4 Hearing and speech

### 2.4.1 Hearing disabilities

- To support people who can't hear, videos should have Closed Captions, subtitles and/or transcripts:
  - Closed Captions for the same language as the spoken audio
  - Subtitles for spoken audio translated into another language
  - Transcripts are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content
  - Sign language uses hand and arm movements, facial expressions, and body positions to convey meaning

### 2.4.2 Speech disabilities

- Mutism, the inability to speak, may occur due to anxiety, brain injuries, or inability to hear and learn speech
- Speech impediments such as stuttering or Tourettes
- Degenerative disease such as Huntington's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
- Being deaf or hard of hearing may also affect speech
- Temporary illness such as coughs or treatment such as chemo that can affect the throat and speech
- Situational impairments such as being in a noisy environment where a website or app can't easily hear or distinguish voice or a quiet environment where it is not possible to be noisy such as in a library.

### 2.4.3 Activity - Closed captions and audio description

### 2.4.4 Knowledge check

- What enables people who are deaf or hard of hearing access audio and video content?
  - Closed Captions
  - A text transcript
- What challenges might someone with limited speech experience on the Web?
  - A contact us page with a phone number and no contact us form the form
  - A voice search on mobile with no text based search

## 2.5 Cognition and learning

### 2.5.1 Cognitive and learning disabilities

- Cognition and learning is as broad as it is varied and can affect different people in very different ways.

### 2.5.2 Commonly encountered challenges

- Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts
  - Flexible design: Reading text can be a challenge for a variety of reasons. It can be to small, too big, the line height too narrow, the style hard to read or the colors difficult to see.
  - Text: Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand can prevent users understanding content and context.
  - Images: Images can be both helpful or distracting depending on how they are used.
  - Movement and animation: Moving, blinking, or flickering content, video or audio that autoplays and cannot be turned off can be distracting for users.

### 2.5.3 Meet Franziska

### 2.5.4 Browser settings and customization

- Increase font size to suit reading needs, this does not increase the size of images or media
- Zoom magnifies all or part of the screen. In the browser it magnifies all content up to 500%
- Use high contrast mode which inverts colors making them easier to read for some users

### 2.5.5 Activity - Customizing content in a browser

- Zoom - Select "Command +" on MacOS or "Control +" on Windows to increase the content of the browser by 500%
- Resize the window - Resize the browser window by dragging the bottom right corner to the left to make a single column layout

### 2.5.6 Knowledge check

- How can the browser be used to adapt content to user preferences?
  - Increase font size
  - Zoom content
- What assistive technologies might a person with autism more commonly use?
  - A screen reader
- Are images useful for Franziska?
  - Yes, images can help with understanding the text.
  - Yes, but too many images can be too distractful.

## 2.6 Where people meet digital technology

### 2.6.1 Essential components of accessibility

- Technology including assistive technology, and web authoring and evaluation tools
- Standards and guidelines including the
  - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG): https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/
  - Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG): https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/
  - User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG): https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/
- People including not just people with disabilities using digital products but everyone involved in creating products and services

### 2.6.2 Technology

- As well as assistive technology, web authoring and evaluation tools are also essential to making content accessible to people with disabilities.

### 2.6.3 Standards and technical specifications

- In order to understand how to author and evaluate accessible content we need to follow guidelines. There are three sets of accessibility guidelines produced by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI):

  - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements on how to make Web content such as text, images, multimedia, structure and presentation accessible
  - Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) defines requirements on how to make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with disabilities can create web content. It also defines requirements how authors can create accessible web content and conform to WCAG
  - User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) provides guidance on how to make user agents accessible to people with disabilities. User agents include browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers and other applications that render web content

### 2.6.4 People

- Everybody involved in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has a role to play:

  - Product owners, and organizations, have a responsibility to mandate and resource teams to create accessible products
  - Developers are responsible for authoring content that follows technology specifications and accessibility guidelines
  - User experience professionals and designers are responsible for creating accessible layouts, images, presentation, features and user journeys as well as carrying our user research and usability testing with people with disabilities
  - Content editors are responsible for content strategy, text, equivalent alternatives for non-text content and other general text elements presented in the pages
  - Quality assurance and testers are responsible for checking for compliance with standards and guidelines using a combination of evaluation tools, assistive technologies, and manual testing

### 2.6.5 Knowledge check

- Which guidelines are considered an essential component of accessibility?
  - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
  - Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)
  - User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)
- Which of the following statements is true?
  - Only using a combination of accessibility evaluation tools and manual testing can tell you how accessible and compliant your site is

### 2.6.6 Bringing it all together

### 2.6.7 Activity - Contact a person with a disability

- Contact a person with a disability and interview them about what accessibility features and barriers they encounter when trying to access digital content or applications.

## 2.7 Conclusion

### 2.7.1 Final thoughts

In Module 2, People and Digital Technology, we learnt about the broad diversity of people with disabilities. We looked at different assistive technologies, and how people with disabilities use these technologies as well as adaptative strategies to help access content. In doing so, we saw the overlap between different types of disability and how different people may use the same assistive technologies.
We touched on examples of content that are challenging for people, as well as highlighted aspects of design that can enhance the inclusive user experience.
Finally, we looked at the inter-dependencies between the components of web accessibility and how technology, standards, guidelines and people, all have a role to play.

### 2.7.2 Assessment - Module 2

- 1. Screen reader
  - What types of user may use a screen reader to acccess digital content
    - a user with learning difficulties
    - a blind user
    - a user with low vision
- 2. Examples of assistive technologies
  - Which of the following are examples of assistive technologies?
    - Glasses
    - Spell checker
    - Specialized keyboard
    - Screen reader
    - Voice assistance such as Alexa, Google home or Cortana
- 3. Essential components of accessibility
  - What are the 'essential componants of accessibility' as described by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)?
    - People, standards and guidelines, and technology
- 4. What types of challenges might people with physical disabilities experience?
  - Poor keyboard accessibility
  - Lack of visible labels on buttons
  - Lack of visible focus
- 5. Can accessibility evaluation tools test the accessibility of images?
  - No, an evaluation tool can only identify if an image has a missing text alternative but can not tell you if that text alternative is appropriate in the context where it is present.
- 6. What do blind people use to enable them to watch and understand video content?
  - What do blind people use to enable them to watch and understand video content? Consider different types of 'video content', for example with and without audio, and people with multiple disabilities.

# Module 3: Business Cases and Benefits

## 3.1 Introduction

### Audio Description

- In this module, we will be covering the business benefits of incorporating digital accessibility principles into an organization's processes.

### 3.1.2 What you will learn - Module 3

- We will examine Return on Investment (ROI) of accessibility, and how it can be part of your Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
- We will also look at:
  - brand reputation
  - human centered design and
  - the legal issues associated with accessibility;

### 3.1.3 Introduction to the video series

## 3.2 Discovering who is impacted by digital accessibility

### 3.2.1 Accessibility is a necessity

- So many different people and groups benefit from digital accessibility including not only people with disabilities and older users, but also:

  - people using a mobile device which doesn’t always act in the same way as a fixed desktop computer or laptop;
  - people with low literacy or who are not fluent in the language;
  - people with low bandwidth connections or using older technologies;
  - new and infrequent users of digital material;
  - people with situational limitations, for example they are in a noisy environment or one that has low light;
  - those who have a temporary disability such as a broken arm;
  - people who are in a situation where they can’t interact with content easily, for example videos with no captions and
  - people who may not consider that their ‘normal’ is not quite the same as that of other people and not consider themselves to have a disability, but still require some accommodations e.g. lowered vision ability due to age, or a slight tremor that affects their hands and arms.

- When a user is unable to complete their business, this may result in:
  - total frustration and possible anxiety for the user as well as the waste of their time;
  - loss of privacy/security for the user;
  - loss of reputation for the organization;
  - loss of revenue for the organization and
  - possible litigation for the organization.

### 3.2.2 Change to be competitive

### 3.2.3 Knowledge check

- Color blindness in males
  - 8%
- Population statistics for vision
  - 15%

### 3.2.4 The electronic curb-cut

- Digital accessibility is best understood as the electronic curb-cut, the digital equivalent of the wheelchair ramp for sidewalks.

### 3.2.5 Accessibility and older people

- Older web users are an increasing market segment and an important target group for many businesses, governments, and other organizations.
- Overlap between the needs of seniors and users with disabilities
- Many older people have age-related impairments that can affect how they use the web, such as declining:
  - vision — including reduced contrast sensitivity, color perception, and near-focus, making it difficult to read web pages;
  - physical ability — including reduced dexterity and fine motor control, making it difficult to use a mouse and click small targets;
  - hearing — including difficulty hearing higher-pitched sounds and separating sounds, making it difficult to hear podcasts and other audio, especially when there is background music; and
  - cognitive ability — including reduced short-term memory, difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted, making it difficult to follow navigation and complete online tasks.

### 3.2.6 Knowledge check

- Yun is an active 85 year old who:
  - has his own blog and posts about art history

## 4.2 W3C accessibility standards

### 4.2.1 Overview

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
- Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)
- User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)

### 4.2.2 POUR principles

- The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines four principles:

  - Perceivable - Information can be presented in different ways; for example, in braille, different text sizes, text-to-speech, or symbols, etc.
  - Operable - Functionality can be used in different modalities; for example, keyboard, mouse, sip-and-puff, speech input, touch, etc.
  - Understandable - Information and functionality is understandable; for example consistent navigation, simple language, etc.
  - Robust - Content can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of browsers, media players, and assistive technologies.

- There are currently two stable versions of WCAG that are both supported by W3C:

  - WCAG 2.0 was published in December 2008, and has become widely adopted as the standard for web accessibility by many businesses and governments around the world. It defines 12 Guidelines under the four POUR principles. Under each Guideline there are more specific Success Criteria divided into three Conformance Levels: A, AA, and AAA. WCAG 2.0 defines 61 Success Criteria.
  - WCAG 2.1 was published in June 2018, to better address accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, people with low vision, and people with disabilities using mobile devices. WCAG 2.1 is fully backward compatible with WCAG 2.0, so that if your content conforms to WCAG 2.1 it also conforms to WCAG 2.0. WCAG 2.1 defines 13 Guidelines and 78 Success Criteria.

- WCAG is supported by non-normative (informative) technical guidance. These are not W3C web standards and can therefore be more regularly updated, for example to address current changes in technology.

- This includes:
  - Understanding WCAG 2 provides background and explanation of the requirements, such as who it benefits and examples. It is a very useful resource for people learning the standard.
  - Techniques for WCAG 2 provides documented ways of meeting the Success Criteria defined by WCAG, advisory good practice, as well as commonly encountered failures in accessibility.
  - How to Meet WCAG 2 (sometimes called Quick Reference) brings all this information together in a dynamic widget with filters to help you select only the information you currently need.

### 4.2.3 Activity - Accessibility guidelines

- Which of the following is not one of the four POUR principles of digital accessibility?
  - Reliable
- Select some of the types of accessibility considerations defined by WCAG:
  - give users enough time to read and use content
  - help users avoid and correct mistakes
  - maximize compatibility with current and future user tools

### 4.2.4 Harmonized standards

W3C web standards, called Recommendations, are developed transparently in an open collaborative space. The W3C Process defines specific roles and responsibilities in working groups, as well as mechanisms for conflict resolution and consensus building. Standards such as WCAG are developed with the involvement of many experts from around the world, including:

- People with disabilities and organizations representing people with disabilities
- Industry, including large, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and independent consultants
- Public bodies and other governmental agencies
- Researchers, including industrial and applied research
- Educators, including formal education and business training
  During the development of W3C standards, working groups regularly issue Working Drafts for review and comments by any member of the public. For standards such as WCAG, it is not uncommon that such drafts receive several hundred comments, which are used to improve the final standard.

- https://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/

## 4.3 Principle 1 - Perceivable

### 4.3.1 Text alternatives

- Text alternatives is a foundational aspect of digital accessibility. There are typically many graphical and non-text objects on the screen, such as images, buttons, form controls. These need text alternatives, which are read aloud by screen readers or used by speech input to activate links for example.
- Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives of WCAG says:
  - Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language.

### 4.3.2 Checking for text alternatives

- Activity - Check text alternatives
- Go to the inaccessible NEWS Before Demo web page (remember that this page is intentionally inaccessible for learning purposes). Use the WAVE tool to check images on this page and answer the following questions:
  - How many images are missing alternative text?
  - How many linked images are missing alternative text?
  - How many spacer images are missing alternative text?
  - What is the current alternative text for this image on the NEWS Before demo page?
  - What do you think would be good alternative text for this image?
  - How did your suggestion for question 5 compare to the text alternatives on this AFTER page?

### 4.3.3 Knowledge check

- Decorative images should include alternative text describing the image.
  - False
- An empty/null text alternative is not the same as a missing alternative text attribute.
  - True
- You should always use phrases like “image of” or “graphic of” to describe an image.
  - False
- Alternative text should be succinct.
  - True
- Which content might need text alternatives?
  - charts
  - graphs
  - images

### 4.3.4 Time-based media

- Time-based media refers to content that is dependent on time. The purpose of this check is to make sure people have access to time-based and synchronized media using alternative formats.
- Guideline 1.2 Time-based Media of WCAG says:
  - Provide alternatives for time-based media.
- This includes media such as the following:
  - audio-only files - example: podcasts
  - video-only files - example: silent video tour of a property
  - video plus audio - example: movies
- These need to have alternative formats for people who:
  - Do not hear the audio information
  - Do not see the visual information
  - Cannot process the information in the provided time
- here are four primary methods for providing alternatives for time-based media:
  - captions
  - transcripts
  - audio descriptions
  - sign language
- Transcripts

  - Transcripts are the full text of the spoken words and important visual information in the media file, to read as an alternative to watching or listening to the media file. Transcripts are text-based documents that serve as an alternative to information presented in an audible and visual format. They are similar to captions, but they take the experience to the next level by including important sound effects and other significant visual descriptions (ex. describing eerie sounds in the background). Depending on your type of video, transcripts may be easy to generate from captions and vice-versa.

- Audio descriptions

  - Audio descriptions are a version of the multimedia file that includes a narrator explaining important visual information - such as unspoken actions and events - for the benefit of people who cannot see what’s happening on the screen. Audio descriptions, unlike captions and transcripts, are a recording of a person explaining the visual aspects of the video that aren’t in the video’s original dialog or narration (ex. describing facial expressions or scenery). Audio descriptions should convey visual information verbally–that dialogue and other sounds cannot.

- Sign language
  - Sign language interpretation for multimedia is when you add a video of an interpreter, sometimes shown in a box to the side of the video, who narrates the audio portion through sign language. If you are live streaming your event, typically the sign language interpreter is in the same room as the speaker. Sign language interpretation is important for multimedia since for many people who are Deaf, sign language is their first and most fluent language. Sign language interpretation is often is more expressive than just written transcripts, so can provide a much richer experience than captions or transcripts alone.

### 4.3.5 Checking for media alternatives

### 4.3.6 Knowledge check

- What are some of the main types of accessible alternatives for multimedia?
  - sign language
  - captions
  - transcripts
  - audio descriptions
- What should captions include?
  - speaker identification
  - meaningful sound effects
  - meaningful music
  - meaningful laughter
- Sign language is the primary language for communicating for some deaf people.
  - True
- Audio descriptions provide which of the following?
  - an alternative for those who cannot see the video content
  - description of the visual information
- Which statement(s) is true about automatic captions?
  - can save you a lot of time and effort
  - need to be edited to ensure correctness

### 4.3.7 Adaptable content

- Guideline 1.3 Adaptable of WCAG says:
  - Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.

### 4.3.8 Checking headings

- Activity - Check headings
- Another way to checks headings is by using the WAVE tool.
  - Open WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool.
  - Type the web page address in the form field
  - Select the [WAVE this page!] button or press enter.
  - The web page will show up in the browser with little icons on it.
  - Anything that looks visually like a heading should have a heading icon (H1 WAVE Tool Icon, H2 WAVE Tool Icon, H3 WAVE Tool Icon, etc.) before it.
  - Anything that does not visually look like heading should not have a heading icon before it.

### 4.3.9 Checking structure

- Images -> Replace images with Alt Attributes
- CSS -> Disable All Styles
- Miscellaneous -> Linearize Page

### 4.3.10 Knowledge check

- There should be several h1 headings on a single page.
  - False
- Typically heading levels should not skip levels. For example, h5 should not directly follow h3 without h4 in between.
  - True
- Which of the following are types of components to look for this basic structure check?
  - lists
  - headings
  - tables
- Adding styles for the different levels of headings is beneficial to screen reader users.
  - False
- A webpage with only h2 headings would help a person using an assistive technology device get a good understanding of the page.
  - False

### 4.3.11 Distinguishable content

- Another important aspect of content design and development is to ensure that people can distinguish relevant information. This check is concerned with making the default presentation as easy to perceive as possible to people with disabilities.
- Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable of WCAG says:
  - Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
- Examples of making content distinguishable include:
  - Color is not used as the only way of conveying information or identifying content
  - Default foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast
  - When users resize text up to 200% or change text spacing, no information is lost
  - Text reflows in small windows (“viewports”) and when users make the text larger
  - Images of text are resizable, replaced with actual text, or avoided where possible
  - Users can pause, stop, or adjust the volume of audio that is played on a website
  - Background audio is low or can be turned off, to avoid interference or distraction
- Do not rely on color alone
- Provide sufficient contrast
- Support content resizing
- Ensure control of audio

### 4.3.12 Checking contrast ratio

- Start
- Settings
- Ease of Access
- High Contrast

  https://contrastchecker.com/

### 4.3.13 Checking text resize

- Activity - Check text resize
- Increasing font size functionality is only available in FireFox web browser.
  - Set zoom to text only.
  - From the menubar, select View > Zoom > Zoom Text Only.
  - Increase zoom to 200%.
  - To incrementally increase zoom with the keyboard:
    - Windows, press Ctrl+[+] (hold down the control key and press the + key at the same time).
  - Usually 4-6 key presses gets to 200%.
  - To check or set the zoom percent from the menu option:
    - Click the menu button.
    - Firefox customization menu zoom percent settings.
    - In the customization menu, click the + button to zoom larger. The number before the + button is the current zoom percent.
    - To confirm that you have text-only zoom set from step 1, make sure that only the text is getting larger, not the images.

### 4.3.14 Knowledge check

- Color should be the only way of conveying information or identifying content.
  - False
- When you put a video which starts automatically up on your website, what should you do?

  - People with visual impairment
  - People with presbyopia
  - Older people
- Images of text should be replaced with actual text mark-up, or avoided where possible.
  - True

### 4.3.15 Discussion

### 4.3.16 Assessment - Perceivable

- Text alternative for an image
  - If you provide text alternative for an active image (ex. link or button), the web content provided by the image should be:
    - able to be read aloud by screen readers
    - displayed on Braille output devices
    - usable by voice recognition (speech input)
- Text alternatives for images
  - Decorative images should include alternative text describing the image.
    - False
- Video accessibility
  - If you use a video (with audio) on your website, you should provide:
    - captions for users who can’t hear sounds
    - audio description for users who can't see video
    - text transcripts as an alternative for users
- Auto-playing music
  - Website and apps that automatically play music can interfere with screen readers and speech input devices.
    - True
- Mark-up for content
  - For users to be able to change the presentation of content, you need to properly code the following structures:
    - headings
    - lists
    - input fields
- Sign language
  - Sign language is the primary language for communicating for some deaf people.
    - True
- Contrast ratio for regular-sized text
  - What is minimum contrast ratio for regular-sized text to meet WCAG A or AA requirements?
    - at least 4.5:1
- Heading order
  - Typically heading levels should not skip levels. For example, h5 should not directly follow h3 without h4 in between.
    - True
- Distinguishable content
  - Web content must be distinguishable to make it easier to see and hear. Good examples include:
    - default text and background color combinations have sufficient contrast
    - all web content is provided in text
- Images of text
  - Images of text should be replaced with actual text mark-up, or avoided where possible.
    - True

## 4.4 Principle 2 - Operable

### 4.4.1 Keyboard accessible

- The keyboard is for many people the primary or only way of using the computer. If all functionality of a webpage works using only a keyboard, that means it can also be used by people using speech input (which creates keyboard input), by mouse (using on-screen keyboards), and by a wide variety of assistive technologies.
- Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible of WCAG says:
  - Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

### 4.4.2 Checking keyboard accessible

- Activity - Check keyboard accessible

  - Use your own keyboard to navigate through and check any web page of your choice. Notice the behavior of video controls in particular!
    - In a browser that supports keyboard navigation with the Tab key (for example, Firefox, IE, Chrome, and Safari; not Opera):
      - In Mac browsers, enable keyboard navigation to all controls.
      - In newer browsers: Select System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts. Select the "All controls" option button.
      - In older browsers: Select System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts. In the "Full Keyboard Access" section, check "All Controls".
    - Click in the address bar, then put your mouse aside and do not use it.
    - Press the Tab key to move through the elements on the page. You can press Shift-Tab to go backwards.
    - To move within elements such as drop-down lists and menu bars, press the arrow keys.

- What to check for

  - Tab to all: Check that you can tab to all content including media player controls. (A common problem is that you cannot tab to media player controls.)
  - Tab away: Check that you can tab away from all elements that you can tab into. (A common problem is the keyboard focus gets caught in media controls and you cannot get out; it's called the "keyboard trap".)
  - Tab order: Check that the tab order follows the logical reading order (e.g., for left-to-right languages: top to bottom, left to right) in sequence.
  - Visual focus: Check that the focus is clearly visible as you tab through the elements, that is, you can tell which element has focus, e.g., links have a gray outline around them or are highlighted.
  - All functionality by keyboard: Check that you can do everything with the keyboard; that is, you don't need the mouse to activate actions, options, visible changes, and other functionality. (A common problem is that some functionality is available only with mouse hover, and is not available with keyboard focus.)

- Tab to all
- Tab away
- Tab order
- Visual focus
- Functionality
- Drop-down
- Image links

### 4.4.3 Knowledge check

- If all functionality of a webpage works using only a keyboard, that means it can also be used with which of the following assistive technology devices?
  - speech input device
  - on-screen keyboard
  - screen reader
- A webpage component should not require a computer mouse.
  - True
- What is a component not keyboard accessible?
  - when a user cannot move out of a component
  - when a user cannot move into a component

### 4.4.4 Enough time

- Imagine you are just finishing reading this sentence when suddenly the page disappears. Very confusing and you may also lose a lot of work. Websites might automatically log you off after a certain period of time without interaction, for security reasons. Yet if you are not told what time period you have or have no possibility to extend that time, then you will also likely end up confused.
- Guideline 2.2 Enough Time of WCAG says:
  - Provide users enough time to read and use content.

### 4.4.5 Knowledge check

- Which of the following groups of people can benefit from having enough time?
  - people with a learning disability
  - people using a switch control
  - people whose native language is different than the language of the page
  - people whose native language is different than the language of the page
- A website that automatically logs you off after a certain period of time with no possibility to extend that time has accessibility best practices in mind.
  - False
- Providing clear information about time limits - and instructions for extending it - is essential for many people.
  - True

### 4.4.6 Avoid seizures and physical reactions

- Content should not flash or blink at a rate of more than three times per second. For some users, flashing or blinking content can trigger a seizure or other photosensitive reactions. Flashing content is ideally avoided entirely or only used in a way that does not cause known risks.
- Guideline 2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions of WCAG says:
  - Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.

### 4.4.7 Checking for moving, flashing, or blinking content

https://trace.umd.edu/peat/

### 4.4.8 Knowledge check

- Content should not flash or blink more than three times per second.
  - True
- Fast moving animations can make people sick or trigger seizures.
  - True
- Animated media must not auto-play for more than ten seconds.
  - False

### 4.4.9 Navigable content

- Previously we learned about the importance of good coding structure to allow users to change the presentation of content. Good structures also support effective navigation. For example, screen reader users often navigate through headings, as Anthony demonstrated earlier on. Jumping from one heading to the next allows him to get an overview of the content and not have to read every detail he may not be interested in.
- Guideline 2.4 of WCAG says:
  - Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

### 4.4.10 Checking page titles

- Activity - Check page titles
  - Go to any search engine and do a search on any topic you are interested in.
  - Review the search results page:
  - Click on one of the search results links and compare the link text you just clicked on to the page title that you just landed on.
  - In your opinion, what was the best title on the first search results page?
  - What do you think made that title good?
  - Repeat for several pages, and consider checking your own website.

### 4.4.11 Knowledge check

- Which of the two titles below is better?
  - Contact Us | Acme Web Solutions, Inc.
- Good page titles will help which of the following groups of people?
  - screen reader users to understand what page they are on
  - all users to know what content is in which browser tab, when they have multiple web pages open
  - all users to find the content they need when reviewing search results
- Which link text should you avoid using?
  - here
  - click here
  - read more
  - download
- Headings with proper mark-up make your content easier to navigate.
  - True
- If a focus indicator is not always visible to a keyboard-only user, the web page will be difficult to use.
  - True

### 4.4.12 Input modalities

- People use many more modalities than keyboard and mouse to interact with computers and the Web. For example, touch screens have become very common on many devices, not only 'mobile' ones. Information stands at train stations, airports, and other public spaces commonly use touch screens. Also gestures, like shaking, tapping, or moving your mobile phone or smart watch to activate functions have become quite common. We've also see Kim using speech input in Module 2, as another example
- Guideline 2.5 Input Modalities of WCAG says:
  - Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard.

### 4.4.13 Knowledge check

- Which of the following are types of input modalities?
  - a keyboard
  - a computer mouse
  - touch screens
  - voice commands
- Design functionality means the website or app accepts input from a variety of different input modalities.
  - True
- Providing larger clickable and touchable areas around buttons, links, and other controls helps which of the following groups of people?
  - users with low hand dexterity

### 4.4.14 Discussion

- Multiple ways
  - How can you help people find information faster on your website?
    - provide links to navigate to related webpages
    - provide a site map
    - provide a search function
- Keyboard functionality
  - If the functionality of a webpage works using a keyboard, it means it is also easier to use with which of the following assistive technology devices?
    - speech input device
    - onscreen keyboard
    - screen reader

# Module 5: Getting Started with Accessibility in your Organization

## 5.1 Introduction

### 5.1.1 Welcome to this module

Every journey has a starting point and a destination.
To meet your accessibility goals, it's important to discover where you're currently at, where you want to go, and have a plan to get there.
Organizations that are mature in accessibility have a clear and detailed action plan.
The plan can include everything from ownership, policies and processes, awareness and capability, and the funding to do all that.

### 5.1.2 What you will learn - Module 5

- At the end of this module, you will be able to:
  - Explain different organizational strategies to plan and manage accessibility
  - Describe ways to explore the accessibility environment in organizations
  - Recognize the need for technical and financial resources for accessibility
  - Describe accessibility policies as a mechanism to reinforce commitment among the organization members
  - Recognize the role of accessibility statements as a way of documenting the current accessibility status and of defining future steps and commitments
  - Distinguish different roles and responsibilities for applying accessibility
  - Describe how to involve people with disabilities throughout projects
  - Understand that accessibility is an ongoing commitment

## 5.2 Discover and plan

### 5.2.1 Introduction to discover and plan

- understand the current state of accessibility
- build enthusiasm for it in your organization
- create a plan develop clear goals
- start to build an environment that supports accessibility

- Explore your current environment – investigate your organization's current state of accessibility and your legal obligations to help understand the work ahead
- Set objectives and allocate resources – create objectives that align with your accessibility goals and ensure you have the necessary resources to meet them
- Gather support and raise awareness – engage and gather support from stakeholders and raise awareness about your accessibility program
- Create your accessibility policy – create an accessibility policy for creating, managing and delivering accessible digital content
- Create your accessibility statements – create accessibility statements for websites, mobile applications or other digital content
- Create a monitoring framework – create a standard way of monitoring and reporting on progress against your accessibility goals

### 5.2.2 Explore your current environment

- Some specific areas to look at include:

  - Governance
    - What accessibility laws, policies or industry standards apply to your organization?
    - Is there an executive sponsor for accessibility in your organization?
  - Policy
    - How well do the existing policies and processes support accessible practices; for example, are there procurement policies to ensure purchasing of accessible tools and content, can accessibility be improved in design and development processes?
  - Awareness and capability
    - What is the general awareness about accessibility in different parts of your organisation?
    - What is the level of accessibility knowledge and expertise of the staff creating and maintaining your digital content? What support is available to improve the situation, such as training or access to accessibility mentors?
  - Assets and tools
    - What digital content do you have, such as websites, intranets, mobile apps, and digital communication channels? What is their current level of accessibility?
    - Do staff have access to appropriate tools to assist in testing accessibility?
  - Finance
    - What, if any, budget is being spent on accessibility?

  - https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/

### 5.2.3 Reviewing authoring tools

In addition to reviewing your digital products and content, it is important to also understand how well authoring tools support you in creating and maintaining accessible content.

### 5.2.5 Set objectives and allocate resources

- Create measurable objectives that address these gaps within the organization’s digital content, processes, and policies. Objectives help to focus your team, clarify what activities need to be planned, define required deliverables, and ensure that successful delivery can be determined.
- When setting objectives, include:
  - deliverables - what are the outcomes you want to achieve
  - timelines - when are you going to achieve these deliverables
  - success measures - how do you know when you've met your objective

_Ensure that objectives have agreement and support from management. This will help secure the necessary resources, align accessibility and business objectives, and reinforce your strategy. Objectives should also help integrate accessibility into existing project frameworks, production workflows, or quality assurance processes._

- Secure budget and resources
- Your budget and resource needs will depend on your accessibility goals and the extent of the work required to achieve them. For each activity, consider what resources are needed and ensure they are available. Some things to consider include:
  - Accessibility evaluations – how often they need to occur and how extensive they need to be
  - Evaluation with people – how will you involve users with disabilities in evaluations
  - Reviews of policies and procedures – how long will it take to determine which policies need to change, make the changes and implement the changes.
  - Recruitment – do you need to recruit accessibility specialists or coordinators to help you meet your accessibility goals
  - Staff training – deliver general awareness-raising as well as specific training targeted on the needs of particular activities, such as design, development or content writing.
  - Tooling – adaptation or possible replacement of content authoring tools, such as the content management system (CMS), or acquiring accessibility evaluation tools
  - Experienced support – external support may be necessary while staff skills and knowledge improve

### 5.2.6 Gather support and raise awareness

To achieve your accessibility goals, support needs to come from across the organization. Support can come from different areas, from design and development teams right through to senior management. Regular communication with management and other stakeholders helps you maintain long-term support for your accessibility goals.

- Support doesn't only come from internal stakeholders. It is also important to engage external stakeholders such as suppliers, advocacy groups, and customers. For example:

  - Negotiate and set expectations with suppliers to better support you with accessibility
  - Develop meaningful relationships with your customers and users to understand what is important to them
  - Provide feedback channels to engage with advocacy groups

- Raise awareness about accessibility
- A lack of awareness is a common reason for organizations not adopting accessible practices. Many people may know little or nothing about accessibility. Some may not appreciate that their role has an impact on digital accessibility. Others may not be aware of the value that accessibility brings. A general introduction to accessibility, including your organizational goals, will improve awareness. It will also build enthusiasm for the task.

- Here are some ideas for raising awareness about accessibility and disability in your organization:
  - Invite people with disability to share their lived experience of disability, how they use technology and how it impacts their lives; make sure people are compensated for their time
  - Invite accessibility leaders and champions from other organizations to talk about how they have raised awareness and capability in their organization
  - Ask accessibility vendors to come in and share their experience on digital accessibility – make sure to be clear this is not an opportunity for a sales pitch!
  - Deliver introduction to accessibility sessions tailored to the accessibility interests of your audience, such as managers, researchers, designers, developers, testers, and content authors
  - Use good quality videos such as the Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards and Web Accessibility Perspectives videos to introduce accessibility and start a group conversation about your accessibility initiatives

### 5.2.7 Introducing accessibility policies

An accessibility policy captures your goals and targets for accessibility in your organization.

- An accessibility policy is a critical document that explains an organization's commitment to accessibility and summarises its approach.
- An accessibility policy is important because it shows commitment towards accessibility.
- It communicates your goals and your targets.
- It sets clear expectations.
- It defines who has responsibility for accessibility.
- And it's ideally signed off at senior management level.
- In instances where new features were going to be released and were not accessible, the policy was referenced to ensure that accessibility requirements were met.
- An accessibility policy can be as simple or as complex as you need it to be.
- Here are some information we'd expect to find in an accessibility policy.
- First, the policy should include relevant standardsand conformance levels such as WCAG 2 level AA.
  - It may also reference other international standards that align with or reference these standards such as EN 301 549 in Europe and Australia and Section 508 from the US.
- Second, the policy should indicate what content is in scope such as websites, apps and documents.
- It should also include the procurement of third party products and services whether these are paid for or free because they are part of your website.
- Third, the policy should set clear milestones.
- We often see policies that state that new and updated content must meet accessibility from a particular date onwards.
- For existing content, there may be a phased approach over a longer period.
- For policy to be effective, it's important that progress against the policy is monitored.
- Are your goals and targets being met?
- If not, why not?
- An ecommerce organisation we worked with set up a steering committee to monitor progress and review the policy and how it was working practically across their organisation.
- They get regular reports from different digital content owners about how each area is meeting the policy.
- Another logistics organisation commissions an external review each year of their main website.
- This gives them an independent review of how they are performing against their policy.

### 5.2.8 Create your accessibility policy

The following guidance is based on the WAI resource Developing an Organizational Policy on Web Accessibility. https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies/

- An accessibility policy captures your goals and targets. Policies vary across organizations but at a minimum establishes what accessibility standard you aim to conform to and by when. For example, your policy might only state that your website will meet all criteria specified in WCAG 2.1 Level AA within one year. A policy may cover other topics such as roles and responsibilities, content preparation processes, quality assurance, infrastructure, and reporting.

- Your accessibility policy may be standalone or integrated into other policies within your organization. Your accessibility policy could be part of a non-discrimination or equal opportunity policy. Related documents should also mention accessibility, such as brand guidelines, coding standards, and project management frameworks. This helps everyone to see accessibility as a core feature, rather than an afterthought.

- Ensure the policy has approval and backing from management. This will help you implement your policy, ensuring that resources are available and activities are prioritized.
- _Reference standards_
- Reference specific standards in policy documents to ensure clear criteria for accessibility. These standards include those that you've already learnt about: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) and User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG).

_Define your conformance level_

- It is critical for the success of your policy to select a conformance level you can realistically achieve: level A, AA or AAA. Once selected, specify what level of conformance is to be achieved for each referenced standard.

_Define the scope of your policy_

- Clearly state the scope of your policy, and how it applies to different parts of the digital content in scope.

- Your policy may apply to:
  - digital assets used by people in your organization, such as intranets
  - digital assets used by people outside your organization, such as websites
  - websites and web content that can be viewed on desktop and/or mobile
  - authoring tools that can be used to create, access or modify content
  - documents, such as electronic newsletters, Word documents, PDFs
  - third-party services, such as credit card payment services or online mapping services
  - third-party platforms, such as video streaming or social media channels
  - non-web digital software, such as mobile apps
  - legacy systems
- If you are using third-party services or platforms, it is your responsibility to ensure they are accessible or for providing accessible alternatives. This is true even if you don't have full control over such content and services.

_Set your milestones_

- For all items in scope of your policy, define clear and measurable milestones, including dates, by which each will be met. If your policy goals and milestones have already been met, then say when the content was last reviewed. Deadlines should be realistic but issues should not be left too long.

- In some cases, a phased approach might be appropriate. You could take an approach that addresses barriers that have the most impact on your users, such as:
  - Fix significant accessibility barriers
  - Fix accessibility barriers that occur in content or features that your user’s need most
  - Fix issues that occur in templates or components used across the product
  - Fix other accessibility barriers
- You could do this as part of a planned maintenance update. Clearly outline any details of this type of approach in your policy.

_Define your monitoring and review process_

- Regularly review progress towards policy goals. Update the policy when there are changes to the timescale or when you meet milestones.
- To maintain the target level of accessibility, specify a process and schedule to review content and tools in scope.

- Feedback from users who might find accessibility barriers can help you identify issues. Your policy should include information on how you will gather feedback. It should also include information how your organization will handle and respond to feedback.

_Optional reading and resources_

- Here are some example policies and templates from the W3C that can help you create your own accessibility policy:

### 5.2.9 Create your accessibility statement

_Why provide an accessibility statement?_
Accessibility statements are important for several reasons, including:

- showing your users that you care about accessibility and about them
- providing your users with information about the accessibility of your content
- demonstrating a commitment to accessibility, and to social responsibility
- In some situations, you may be required to provide an accessibility statement, such as public bodies in countries that implement the EU Web

Accessibility Directive.

_What to include in an accessibility statement?_
Accessibility statements should contain at least the following:

A commitment to accessibility for people with disabilities
The accessibility standard applied, such as WCAG 2.1
Contact information in case users encounter problems
It is also advisable to include the following information:

Any known limitations, to avoid frustrating of your users
Measures taken by your organization to ensure accessibility
Technical prerequisites, such as supported web browsers
Environments in which the content has been tested to work
References to applicable national or local laws and policies
Note that in some situations you may be required to provide particular content in your accessibility statements. For example, there are specific requirements for accessibility statements in relation to the EU Web Accessibility Directive.

_How to write an accessibility statement?_
Accessibility statements are primarily for users of your content. Usually, they will refer to accessibility statements when they encounter problems. Technical or legal language will likely lead to confusion and increase frustration rather than help your users. It is important to write in simple language rather than use the language of developers and lawyers. Make sure that the information is useful and relevant to your users.

In particular, accessibility statements should explain functionality and known limitations in common terms. For example, rather than to say “WCAG Success Criterion 1.2.2 was not met”, it is better to say “videos do not have captions”. Accessibility statements are not technical assessments or declarations of conformity. They should, however, refer to such background to provide verification and increase credibility.

_Where to put an accessibility statement?_
Accessibility statements should be easy to find. Linking them from several places, such as from the footer, help menu, sitemap, about page, and other prominent areas help users to find them. Use consistent link names for your accessibility statements to help users recognize them. This includes link names within the content of your website and mobile app, as well as across groups of related websites and mobile apps. For example, use the same link name on all web pages to refer to an accessibility statement for that website, and use that same link name to refer to the accessibility statement of the mobile app version of the website.

_Accessibility statement generator tool_
The accessibility statement generator tool helps you create an accessibility statement for your own website, mobile app, or other digital content. You can download the statement you created, and further customize, style, and brand it.

This tool can be used in different contexts and jurisdictions. These situations can be so different that we cannot provide support for each one individually. For example, you may be subject to a particular organizational policy, quality assurance process, or law that requires you to provide certain information in your accessibility statement.

This generator tool allows you to enter different types of information to create accessibility statements for your particular situation. You can download the generated accessibility statement to further customize it for your own needs.

### 5.2.10 Activity - Accessibility statements

_Accessibility statement checklist_
Use the following accessibility statement checklist to see how your accessibility statement could be improved. Although you don't have to provide all the information in the checklist in your statement, think about what information will help your users when deciding if your accessibility statement can be enhanced.

_Basic information_
The name of your organization
The name of your website or mobile app
The address of your website or mobile app
The accessibility standard you have following, including version and level
The degree to which you conform with the accessibility standard
Any additional accessibility requirements you've included in your product beyond what is required by your chosen accessibility standard
Information about how users can get in touch with your organization - ideally providing multiple options
When your accessibility statement was published or last updated
_Your efforts_
A description of what your organization has done to achieve sustainable accessibility
_Technical information_
A list of any content parts that have accessibility limitations
A list of environments (combinations of web browsers, assistive technologies, and operating systems) the content is expected to work with, and any exceptions
A list of technologies that are relied upon for conformance
The approach you took when assessing your website or mobile app against your chosen accessibility standard
_Approval or complaints process_
The name and role of the person in your organization who may have formally approved this accessibility statement
Information about a formal complaints procedure

### 5.2.11 Create a monitoring framework

- To track progress, create a standard way of monitoring and reporting findings to stakeholders across your organization.

- Milestones can help you measure your progress. Ensure that each milestone has specific and measurable criteria to indicate what progress has occurred.

- Some example criteria include:
  - number of WCAG Success Criteria passed, and their level
  - number of complaints received related to accessibility
  - calls handled from people who were unable to process their application online
  - positive social media comments on the accessibility of service
  - training sessions on accessibility delivered to the staff
- Ensure that accessibility progress is part of standard reporting for all parts of your organization that have accessibility responsibility.

- It is useful to develop a standard report structure to capture the measure of accessibility for websites or tools. This allows for comparisons between different websites, as well as between different versions of the same website.

- For long-term or ongoing goals, you need to plan regular monitoring to ensure that achieved goals do not slip. When goals aren't being met and issues are identified, ask why these issues are occurring. Some questions to consider include:
  - Are issues caused by staff members who have not had adequate training?
  - Are they as a result of a change in the content management system (CMS)?
  - Are the requirements of the publishing process unclear?
- Plan for regular reviews to monitor progress over time. Assign responsibility for the checks and ensure there are clear escalation paths for issues

### 5.2.12 Knowledge check

- What areas should you explore when you want to understand the current state of accessibility in your organization?
  - Key websites, mobile apps and digital content
  - Policies and processes, such as those related to editing and publishing
  - Awareness of, and attitude towards, accessibility and disability
  - Accessibility laws and policies that apply to your organization
- To successfully implement digital accessibility in your organization, you should seek support from
  - senior management
  - design and development teams
  - suppliers
  - disability organizations
  - marketing and communications
- How does support from senior management help meet your accessibility goals?
  - By prioritizing competing accessibility objectives
  - By securing resources and budget
  - By enabling champions for accessibility
- Which of the following are good examples of accessibility objectives?
  - Update your design system to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA by September
  - Include accessibility guidance in your ICT framework in 18 months
- Your accessibility policy may be:
  - either of the above
- Accessibility statements are important because they
  - show users that you care about accessibility and about them
  - show commitment to social responsibility
  - provide information about the accessibility of your content
  - provide contact options for people to get in touch with you about accessibility feedback
- When monitoring your progress, it is important to
  - assign responsibility for monitoring and reporting
  - ensure there are clear escalation paths when issues occur

## 5.3 Implement and maintain

### 5.3.1 Introduction to implement and maintain

- In the discover and plan stage (Part 1 of Module 5), you should have learned how to:

  - understand the current state of accessibility
  - build enthusiasm for accessibility in your organization
  - create a plan to develop clear goals
  - start to build an environment that supports accessibility

- In this second part, you'll learn how to implement accessibility and then maintain your achievements. Together, let's explore 5 aspects of this:
  - Accessibility is a shared responsibility - we'll look at what aspects of accessibility different roles shod assume
  - Skills need to be built - and maintained as the environment and staff change
  - Products need to be created accessibility - and future enhancements need to also meet your organization's commitments
  - Changes need to be monitored - platform changes, technology changes, standards and legal requirement changes, and policy and skills kept up to date
  - Stakeholder engagement - this needs to continue with both internal and external stakeholders

### 5.3.2 Accessibility and roles

- The team has responsibility to design, build, operate and iterate digital services, led by a product manager with decision-making responsibility. The team, and their responsibilities for accessibility, would look like:
  - product manager (product owner) - overall responsibility
  - user researcher - ensuring people with disability are included
  - interaction designer - considers the different ways people access the web
  - graphic designer - colour and contrast choices
  - content author/designer - content structure and readability
  - developer - semantic coding
  - QA/tester - checks all good before release

### 5.3.3 Roles and responsibilities

- Each role has a range of responsibilities.
  - Product owners have to ensure that accessibility is considered throughout and the team has the skills to do this.
  - User researchers need to ensure that they include people with a range of disabilities, along with consideration such as age, location, gender and digital literacy in their research and usability testing.
  - Content makers need to make sure that the content is accessible and understandable to all audiences. This includes text content, multimedia, and interactive content like forms.
  - Designers need to design for all users. This can include clear, flexible designs, colour and contrast and interactions using different technologies, such as keyboard, touch or speech.
  - Developers need to make sure their code is semantic and use HTML where possible and enhance with ARIA when needed.
  - QA testers will find any accessibility issues that have unintentionally been missed earlier.
  - To make sure everyone is able to fulfil their responsibilities, building capability through training and access to support is key to success.

### 5.3.4 Activity - Roles

### 5.3.5 Build and maintain skills

_Build awareness and develop skills_

- Back in Gather Support and Raise Awareness (Section 5.2.6) we talked about raising awareness by organising some sessions where people with disability 'share their lived experience of disability, how they use technology and how it impacts their lives' (making sure people are compensated for their time). This is a great way to get the team, and the wider organization, interested in the experience some people have when using the web and apps differently from the way most of them probably experience it. Many teams find this to be the 'light bulb' moment when they see that accessibility delivers real results to people.

- We all know about training and skills development in general. It applies to accessibility as well:

  - Training is an initial investment that pays off as understanding of accessibility increases and it becomes more common practice.
  - Increased knowledge should result in more accessible implementations first time, helping to reduce evaluation and rework costs and limit risk.

- You need to consider the roles of the entire team and make sure they all increase the knowledge and skills relative to the role they have. Examples of training include:
  - Introductions to accessibility for everyone
  - How accessibility benefits your business for management and project managers
  - Accessible design for graphic and UX designers
  - Writing accessible content for non-technical content authors
  - Accessible coding solutions for developers
  - Testing for accessibility for QA and testers
    _eLearning_
- Many organizations like to have essential learning available in-house for staff to take during on-boarding or as periodic refreshers. Unfortunately many eLearning platforms are not accessible to all staff if some of them have a disability. When looking for eLearning platforms, a key question are how well they meet WCAG and ATAG.

- If they don't fully meet WCAG or ATAG, what is their roadmap to meet the standards and what usability testing they are doing as part of this? How are you going to enable staff with disability to access the learning?

_Maintain skills into the future_

- Accessibility training is not a once-off 'tick and forget' activity. The knowledge and skills of your digital teams need to be monitored on a regular basis to be sure people are up-to-date.

- Organizations often find that web teams have regular staff changes, especially if contractors are a key part of a team. It is essential that new staff are supported to gain the skills and expertise needed to meet your ongoing accessibility goals.

- As technologies and standards change (discussed in a later section), you need to ensure web teams maintain and improve their skills to continue to deliver accessible and usable digital products and content in line with your organisation's commitment.

### 5.3.6 Activity - Potential training

### 5.3.7 Create accessibly

_Evaluate and prioritize_
The earlier you evaluate a project for accessibility, the more accessible it will be at the end as you'll have caught and addressed issues early and not repeated them.

Likewise, if you've evaluated existing web content or a mobile app, it makes sense to prioritise the fixes to get the largest benefit from your remediation.

_Evaluate early_
Evaluate early and often during design and development:

- undertake research with your users before deciding on the solution
- check designs and mockups before you start coding
- check your content as it's being written for plain language and understanding, including micro-content for forms and errors, and for alternative text for images
- check the code as each component is being built - learn and adapt rather than waiting until the end
- undertake usability testing with people with disabilities on a regular basis as well as technical WCAG testing
  The Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) provides an approach for evaluating existing websites.

_Prioritize accessibility issues to address_
While all accessibility objectives will need to be met, prioritizing can help you achieve them more effectively. Examples of prioritization include:

- Start with issues that are easier to fix, to help build motivation in the team and demonstrate success.
- Prioritize the development of accessible templates and components to support the creating of accessible content.
- Prioritize visual design to synchronize with an on-going re-branding activity within the organization.
- Prioritize recruitment or procurement policies to support anticipated hiring and acquisitions.
- De-prioritize issues that are related to tools or systems, such as a content management system (CMS), that are expected to be changed soon anyway.
- Involve different perspectives, including internal and external stakeholders, in the prioritization process. Review the situation regularly to benefit from arising opportunities.

You can also prioritize based on

- the impact an accessibility issue is likely to have on users
- the importance or frequency of access of any page or section.
  For example if just a single step in a shopping check-out process had accessibility issues, then fixing that obviously enables the checkout process to be completed by more people. This will increase your organization's revenue and support the business case you developed in Module 3.

_Assign tasks to roles and fix priorities_
During the planning stage in Section 5.2, we talked about assigning responsibilities to the wider organization. Now we've identified issues with a digital product or content area we need to assign the responsibility for addressing and fixing the issue to the appropriate team member with the right role and understanding to solve and fix the issue.

To put it clearly:

- Communicate deliverables and assignments to assigned team members. Ensure staff know what is expected of them, that they have the necessary capabilities, and are clear on schedules. Ensure that everyone has the resources to help them with their tasks. Provide a clear process for people to flag issues and ensure that any issues raised are managed and responded to efficiently.

- Individuals in multi-disciplinary teams are likely to have responsibility for meeting different parts of your accessibility standard. Be specific about each individual’s responsibility. For example, visual designers may be responsible for success criteria concerned with the visual elements of content, and developers are concerned with those related to the underlying code. Similarly, a contracts team may be responsible for ensuring that the procurement process includes accessibility requirements for third-party content.

_Accessible Procurement_
Often organizations outsource some, or all, of the design or development. This can occur in projects where a new service must integrate with existing databases or other existing functionality. It can also occur in situations like the preparation of glossy reports that will also reside on the web or for the production of corporate videos.

Many organizations decide to have standard clauses in 'requests for quotes' for design or development about the need for any deliverable they are outsourcing to be accessible. For web content and mobile apps they include conformance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) at Level AA. however, some organizations like to go further and include several key Level AAA criteria such as:

- 1.4.11 – Non-text Contrast
- 2.4.9 – Link Purpose (Link Only)
- 2.5.5 – Target Size
  In Europe, and Australia, governments and many private organisations are referencing the European standard for Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services – EN 301 549 v3.1.1 (PDF 2.2Gb) which incorporates WCAG.

Some organizations also insert accessibility clauses into all standard ICT contracts, including payment penalties if the delivered product fails to meet their accessibility standard after testing the delivered product.

### 5.3.8 Involve users

- Web accessibility is not just about meeting a technical standard, it's about ensuring that our websites, mobile apps, and digital documents can be used by the widest possible audience, including people with disability. Involving users throughout a project will help you deliver on this.
- In addition to finding accessibility problems, evaluating with users with disabilities usually reveals general usability problems that impact all users, including those without disabilities.
- The material in this unit draws heavily on:
  - Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility which describes the benefits of involving users in projects and how to go about it
  - Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility which goes into more depth about how and when to engage users

Where to find users with disability
When to involve users
Analyzing user results

### 5.3.9 Involving users

### 5.3.10 Monitor changes

- The web and its technologies are constantly changing. The standards and policies related to web accessibility are also being updated more regularly to keep up with new technologies and societies expectation of everyone being able to use the web as human right as declared in the UN Convention on the rights of people with disabilities.
  _Monitor policies and standards_
- Policies and standards that your organization is conforming with can be updated – you need to keep abreast of these. For example:
  - The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are on a regular update path
    - WCAG v2.1 was released in June 2018 and v2.2 is expected in late 2020
    - The WCAG advisory techniques and understanding WCAG documents are updated more frequently
    - Accessibility Guidelines v3 (nicknamed ‘Silver’ for AG) is expected in late 2022
  - WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications suite of web standards, is also updated regularly
    - WAI-ARIA v1.1 was released in December 2017
    - WAI-ARIA v1.2 is under development
- Government policies and ISO or local standards are also updated regularly. This is often to reflect updates in WCAG, meaning the policies and related standards usually lag behind WCAG releases.

- The W3C's Web Accessibility Laws & Policies page lists laws from around the world that you might need to keep track of, especially if your organisation has multi-national operations.

_Monitor skills requirements_

- Staff changes are common in technical teams and in other areas in organizations such as marketing. As a result, making sure new staff have the skills to deliver on your organizations accessibility commitments has to be a priority in on-boarding. Staff may also be changing roles or adopting new roles, especially in small organizations, so making sure they understand the accessibility responsibilities in the new or additional role is critical.

- The other side of maintaining skills is the evolution of application frameworks (especially SPAs - Single Page Apps) that are constantly changing with new frameworks regularly appearing. Keeping abreast of accessibility in these frameworks is an ongoing challenge for web teams. In a related manner, many larger organizations are developing their own Design Systems and these need to be built to meet accessibility standards. They also need to be kept up to date as the standards and their supporting techniques change.
  - Staff who already have the basic knowledge and skills can often benefit from attending professional conferences and meetings, including those with a focus on accessibility.
  - The Web Design Events page maintained by the University of Minnesota lists many of the accessibility conferences held around the world.
    Web accessibility related meetups, held around the world, are also a good opportunity to meet and learn from others.
    _Monitor new technologies_
- We've seen a lot of development in voice-driven apps in recent years. However, we need to be aware of the need to provide people with choice in how they access our digital content.

### 5.3.11 Importance of monitoring changes

### 5.3.12 Activity - Monitor changes

### 5.3.13 Continue engagement

- It s important to continue to engage with both internal and external stakeholders to maintain momentum.

  - Internal stakeholders will want to know that progress continues to be made and that the organizations commitments are being met.
  - External stakeholders will also need to be reminded of your commitment and assured that you are continuing to meet their expectations around accessibility.

_Internal Stakeholders_

- Continue working with internal teams - web, ICT, marketing, etc - to ensure that accessibility remains a priority, particularly when it comes to new projects and initiatives.

- Long-term engagement should also consider how accessibility changes are impacting project delivery:

  - Are projects costing less?
  - Is less time needed to ensure that accessibility is covered?
  - Are there less problems at the end of projects?
  - Are the users providing more positive feedback, or less complaints, about accessibility?
  - Ensure that any on-going customer support is able to respond to users' accessibility issues. This will include training for first line support and clear processes for recording and addressing issues.

- Make sure you keep your organization's management informed of ongoing progress to help ensure their ongoing support and commitment.

_External Stakeholders_
**External Suppliers**

- Continue to work with any of your external suppliers who are still to meet your accessibility requirements. Be sure to keep them informed of any changes to your expectations such as a change in your accessibility policy to a new version of WCAG. If existing external suppliers are continuing to provide support, ensure they continue to meet your accessibility expectations.

- You also need to ensure that any new external suppliers who might be providing development services for websites, mobile applications or multimedia are aware of your accessibility requirements and expectations.

**External users**

- Keeping external people who provide accessibility feedback 'in the loop' will make them feel involved in the improvement process and can help to minimize formal complaints and legal cases. Make sure you acknowledge any accessibility feedback you get and let the person know how you will be addressing the issue and when.
