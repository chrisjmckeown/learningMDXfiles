# Introduction

- Nextjs
- Tailwind
- NX
- Cypress
- Storybook

# Create Nx project/workspace

- Below will change as the version of Nx evolve
- `npx create-nx-workspace name --packageManager=yarn`
- Which stack do you want to use? `React`
- What framework would you like to use? `Next.js`
- Standalone project or integrated monorepo? `Integrated Monorepo:  Nx creates a monorepo that contains multiple projects.`
- Application name `first-project-name`
- Would you like to use the App Router (recommended)? `Yes`
- Default stylesheet format `CSS`
- Enable distributed caching to make your CI faster `Yes`
- Then the install will happen.

# Create a Next.js Web Application with Nx

- `yarn nx g @nx/next:app my-new-app`
- `yarn nx run help:serve` to spin up a particular app
  - go to http://localhost:4200/about
- `yarn nx serve help`
- can run serve directly if NX addin is installed

# Create a new Next.js Page Component with Nx Generators

- Can add pages using NX generator if installed

# Understanding Next.js GetStaticProps

- getStaticProps
- getStaticPaths

# Understanding Next.js getStaticPaths

- yarn nx g @nrwl/next:page --name="[slug]" --style=none --directory=articles --dry-run
- http://localhost:4200/articles/Page1

# Setup Next.js with Tailwind in a Nx Workspace

- yarn add tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
- See help: https://nx.dev/recipes/other/using-tailwind-css-in-react
- cd apps/help - because we are in a monorepo site
- npx tailwindcss init -p
- edit postcss.config.js
- Also needed to apps/help/tailwind.config.js
  - tailwind V3 now only builds with the styles in use, so you need to specify the content location
- load @tailwind modules into styles.css

# Configure Tailwind purging in a Nx Workspace

- yarn nx build help
- tailwind V3 no more need to purge, but can optimize in other ways https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production

# Configure Tailwind in a Nx Monorepo With Potentially Multiple Apps and Libs

- Typography
  - yarn add @tailwindcss/typography
  - add @tailwindcss/typography to plugins to tailwind.config.js
- Add global NX wide tailwind settings for each app to use
  - create a file at the root of the NX project, tailwind-workspace-preset.js
  - add common config here then import this to the app under presets

# Configure And Use TailwindCSS JIT Mode With Nx

- this is no longer required in V3
- Use getStaticPaths to Retrieve a List of Markdown Files to Render With Next.js
- create an \_articles folder at root
- create a POST_PATH variable
- update getStaticPaths
- Generate an Nx Library to Implement our Markdown Rendering for our Next.js App
  - Create a library with NX
- Parse a Markdown Document With gray-matter
  - yarn add gray-matter --save-dev
- Render Markdown With next-mdx-remote in our Next.js Page Component
  - yarn add next-mdx-remote --save-dev
- Embed React Components in our Markdown with MDX in a Next.js App
  - yarn nx g @nrwl/react:library mdx-elements --directory=shared
- Use React Components for Native HTML Tags with MDX and Next.js
- Dynamically Loading React Components with next-mdx-remote and Next.js Dynamic imports
- Using Environment Variables with Next.js and Nx
- Add Fast Refresh Support to our MDX Files with Nx Support for Custom Next.js Servers
  - yarn add chokidar
- Scaffold a New Blog Post Article Automatically With Nx Workspace Generators
  - customServerTarget fails to run
- Scaffold a New Blog Post Article Automatically With Nx Workspace Generators
  - yarn nx g @nrwl/workspace:workspace-generator new-article
- Run an Nx Generator With the Nx Console VSCode Extension
  - yarn nx workspace-generator new-article "my generated article" --author=test
- Run an Nx Generator With the Nx Console VSCode Extension
- Add prompts to an Nx Workspace Generator

# Configure Storybook for your React Based Nx Workspace Library

- yarn nx generate @nrwl/react:library ui --directory=shared --no-interactive
- yarn nx generate @nrwl/react:component topic-button --style=css --project=shared-ui
- yarn nx generate @nrwl/react:storybook-configuration shared-ui --cypressDirectory=storeybook-e2e --no-interactive
  - root level .storybook is no longer created

# Configure Tailwind for your Storybook Setup in an Nx Workspace

- cd libs/shared/ui
- npx tailwindcss init -p
- copy tailwind settings from other app

# Develop React Components in Isolation with Storybook and Nx

- Something is broken with the SVG, need to come back to this

# Share React Components in Next.js Applications with Nx Workspace Libraries

- yarn nx g @nrwl/next:page --name=topics --project=help

# Write e2e Tests for our Next.js Application with Nx and Cypress

- yarn nx e2e help-e2e --watch

# Write Cypress Tests for our React Storybook Components with Nx

- yarn nx e2e storeybook-e2e-ui-e2e --watch

# Export a Next.js Application with Nx

- yarn nx export help
- cd dist/apps/help/exported/
- npx http-server
  - http://127.0.0.1:8080/

# Setup Vercel to Deploy an Nx Based Next.js Application

- yarn nx build help --prod
- Create a vercel account
- Connect to github
- select the project
- for Build and Output settings:
  - Build Command: npx nx build help --prod
  - Output directory: dist/app/site/.next

# Only Build What Changed with Nx Affected Commands

- yarn nx g @nrwl/react:application reactapp
- yarn nx dep-graph
- yarn nx affected:dep-graph --base="branchname" - will show affected linked apps, libs etc
- yarn nx affected:build --base="branchname", will only build what has been affected

# Register our Markdown Articles with the Nx Dependency Graph

- can add a project.json to any folder for Nx to track.
- add "implicitDependencies": ["help-articles" ] to any other project.json files that should be affected and trigger a build

# Only Deploy to Vercel What has Been Affected Using Nx

- yarn nx affected:dep-graph --base="branchname"
- yarn nx affected:apps --plain --base="branchname"
- changed since time of recording to https://nx.dev/recipes/other/deploy-nextjs-to-vercel#skipping-build-if-the-application-is-not-affected

- Something is broken with the SVG, need to come back to this, only failing with storybook
- Only accepting .mdx, need to extend to .md
