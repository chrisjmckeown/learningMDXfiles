  - In code: bad
  - In config
  - Our remotely like

    - PM?

  - WIP limit
    - Limit the number of feature flags in the code base at any one time.. 2?
    - Consider feature flags _work in flight_
    - How much work in flight do you want to have at any given point?
    - The people feeling the consequences of tech debt are not always the people prioritizing the work
